*An illustration of the universality in high-dimension: The training loss is shown as function of the number of samples n per input dimension p at vanishing regularization. In the left panel the square loss, in the right panel the hinge loss. The black solid line represents the
outcome of the theoretical calculation for iid Gaussian inputs, while dots refer to numerical simulations on different full-rank datasets.*

## Structure

In this repository we provide the code and some guided example to help the reader to reproduce the figures of the paper [1]. The repository is structured as follows.

| File                          | Description                                                                                                                                                    |

| ```/K2mix``` | Solver for the fixed point equations of the order parameters in the case of classification tasks on K=2 Gaussian clusters with nonhomogeneous diagonal covariances. The notebook [```how_to.ipynb```](https://github.com/gsicuro/GaussMixtureProject/blob/main/K2mix/how_to.ipynb) provides a step-by-step explanation on how to use the package. This implementation has been used to produce the results in Section 3.1 of the paper.           |

The notebooks are self-explanatory.
